👋 Hi, I’m @laurenbeckman

I’m currently pursuing a B.S. Chemical Engineering with a focus in clean energy.

My interest is in dovetailing STEM with humanities by intertwining my passions in Chemical Engineering, Economics and Finance, and Intellectual Property Law. 

My goal is to utilize my broad-scoping background to help develop and protect nuanced, informed, and inclusive clean energy solutions, locally and globally.

Although I'm not pursuing CompSci, I would like to gain background knowledge on the subject. With any luck, maybe I'll start a side project or two!
