ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @laurenbeckman

Iâ€™m currently pursuing a B.S. Chemical Engineering with a focus in clean energy.

My interest is in dovetailing STEM with humanities by intertwining my passions in Chemical Engineering, Economics and Finance, and Intellectual Property Law. 

Although I'm not pursuing CompSci, I would like to gain background knowledge on the subject. Maybe I'll start a side project or two!
